### Hi I'm Rafa ğŸ˜„ :wave: :computer:
## I am a recent Junior Full Stack Developer, based in London, recently gratuated from a intense and selective development course in Makers Academy, London, with a strong backgroung in business management in an office environment and a Lawyer with my own legal practice office. I have decided to pursue my real passion, Tech, and I have not regretted it not even for a minute. I have found in code my real passion in life and I am now a happy and frustrated (do you relate with this??) coder.
